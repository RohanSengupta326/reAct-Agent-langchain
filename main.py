"""
This is the similar implementation of agent with reAct prompt but how under the hood tool calling is handled
as shown previously in ice-breaker

Manual Step-by-Step Execution:

Uses a while loop to manually handle each step of the agent's thought process
Explicitly tracks intermediate steps in memory
Manages the back-and-forth between thinking and tool execution


Text-Based Parsing:

Uses a specific text format (Question/Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation)
Relies on ReActSingleInputOutputParser to extract actions from the text output
The agent's thinking is explicitly included in the prompt via "agent_scratchpad"


Tool Management:

Tools are manually executed using a helper function (find_tool_by_name)
Results are formatted and added to intermediate steps
